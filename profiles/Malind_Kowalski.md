### Why Do You Love Coding?
Coding is so challenging but what I love about coding is that I can think of multiple and creative ways to solve my assignment.  Though I may spend an hour, a whole day or even a week on a project, the feeling of building successful code is unmatched.  Also the community of new, experienced, thoughtful, kind, intelligent, supportive coders is ever-welcoming and willing to help others learn the world of programming.

### Your Favorite Animal
A tie between turtles and dogs

### Your Favorite Dessert
I can only choose one? I go with tiramisu.
